# Intro to DNA
DNA is the instruction manual for all living things. It tells cells how to grow, function, and respond to the world. By studying DNA, scientists can understand how traits are passed down, why diseases happen, and how to create better medicines. One of the most important parts of DNA is how its pieces pair upâ€”something called base pairing. 

DNA is made up of four bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). The base pairs are A-T and C-G. 

With this knowledge of base pairs, play DNA Dynamite to become more familiar with the DNA base pairing and other aspects of DNA!

# Playing the Game

<div class="slider">
  <div class="slides">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/play/instructions.png" alt="Slide 1">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/play/start.png" alt="Slide 2">
  </div>
</div>

Read through the instructions and click start game, or simply click the x at the top right corner of the instructions popup

<div class="slider">
  <div class="slides">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/play/startbutton.png" alt="Slide 1">
  </div>
</div>

Click start on the menu menu to the left to start the game. 

<div class="slider">
  <div class="slides">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/play/missing.png" alt="Slide 1">
  </div>
</div>

As the strands continue to move up and off the screen, type in the correct base in the missing slots of the DNA strand. Remember: A pairs with T and C pairs with G. 

<div class="slider">
  <div class="slides">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/play/wrong.png" alt="Slide 1">
  </div>
</div>

Correct answers turn the missing slot green and wrong answers turn the slot red. If you get it wrong, quickly try to fill in the correct pair before the DNA goes away. 

<div class="slider">
  <div class="slides">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/play/score.png" alt="Slide 1">
  </div>
</div>

Each time you complete a strand, your score on the left increases by 1. If you fail to complete the DNA strand, you lose one out of three lives. 


<div class="slider">
  <div class="slides">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}images/play/3hearts.png" alt="Slide 1">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/play/score.png" alt="Slide 2">
  </div>
</div>

The three hearts on the right side of the screen represent the three lives you have per game. Once a life is lost, the heart disappears and cues a heart shatter sound to let you know you have lost a life.

Once all three lives are lost, the game stops and the trivia quiz pops up on the screen. The quiz contains DNA related question in which you must choose the correct answer to continue playing the game. If you get the question right, you can click on the x at the top right corner of the popup and continue playing the game. If you get the question wrong, a Gemini sourced explaination will appear, teaching you what the correct answer is supposed to be. Continue the quiz until you get a question right and are able to exit out of the popup.

After completing the trivia quiz, click restart on the left menu to restart the game and begin to play again.
