    "        <p class=\"mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300\">Wireframing UI components, planning interactivity, and defining backend endpoints. We started off by drawing individual parts of the game on the whiteboard and then connecting them together to create one big final whiteboard design. As we progress on making the code for the game we chaged the desing and made a more professional prototype of the game on canva. As we wrapped up making the game there were a few changed but our intial ideas were still leading and present.</p>\n",

    "        <p class=\"mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300\">Implementing the game loop, animation logic, and backend API integration. Each person in the team worked together but on indiviual parts, broken up, to create various features and aspects of the game. When each part was created, like the trivia quiz, hearts, DNA strands, and leaderbaords were working on their own; they were then connected and merged. After sucessfully making sure the game worked together we added each part to create one big \"featutre\" that a user could play as the DNA dynamite game. </p>\n",

The team spent around 2 weeks + working out kinks and bugs that they ran into. After a few weeks of fixing up errors and small design changes the game was much more polished and ready to be deployed and presented.</p>\n",
