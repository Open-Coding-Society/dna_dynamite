    "<br>\n",
    "Our team is currently using a Gemini API to dynamically source trivia questions for the pop-up feature that appears when a player loses all three lives (the 3 hearts at the top right of the screen break). The gemini API ensures that the questions are random but also closely related to DNA and genetics, maintaining relevance to the game theme.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "When a user loses their third life (the last heart breaks), the frontend fetches a trivia pop-up with a genetics-related question. To avoid any bias in question selection, the backend sends a custom prompt to the Gemini API, which responds with:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - A trivia question<br>\n",
    "\n",
    " - Four answer choices<br>\n",
    "\n",
    " - The correct answer<br>\n",
    "\n",
    " - An explanation<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This information is then displayed on the frontend. If the user answers incorrectly, the explanation is shown to help reinforce genetics knowledge before the next attempt.<br>\n"
