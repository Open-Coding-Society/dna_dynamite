    "# Inspiration:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team's inspiration for **DNA Dynamite** came from the popular mobile game **Block Blast**.  \n",
    "Our game works in a similar manner by fitting and matching the correct DNA nucleotides to \"blast\" the DNA strands, much like clearing blocks in Block Blast.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **DNA Dynamite**, if a player matches the wrong DNA nucleotides three times, they lose all their hearts and the game ends â€” similar to running out of moves in Block Blast.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Block Blast Reference:\n",

    "# How to Play:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our game provides a detailed instruction manual for users before gameplay begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "To play **DNA Dynamite**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Drag and drop base pairs from the \"Bank of Bases\" into their corresponding empty spots on the DNA strands.\n",
    "- Complete each DNA strand correctly before it disappears.\n",
    "- If a strand disappears before completion, you lose one life.\n",
    "- If you lose three lives, you must answer three trivia questions to revive and continue playing.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of the game, players are also provided with a nucleotide base-pairing key as a reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adenine (A)** pairs with **Thymine (T)**\n",
    "- **Guanine (G)** pairs with **Cytosine (C)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that even players without prior DNA knowledge can still succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objectives of our game are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Teach DNA nucleotide base-pairing concepts.\n",
    "- Create an interactive game to aid learning through play.\n",
    "- Promote active recall through engaging gameplay mechanics.\n",
    "- Incorporate game-based learning with real consequences (loss of lives).\n",
    "- Introduce educational challenges (trivia) as a revival mechanism.\n",
    "- Provide support and guidance for beginner-level players.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# User Story:\n",
    "\n",
    "As a follower of Illumina's social media account, I feel awed but intimidated by the impressive research being conducted by scientists. However, I notice a link at the top of the page to a game that promises to teach me about DNA and Illumina in an easy-to-learn format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon clicking the game link, I follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read the game instructions that pop up.\n",
    "- Press the **Start Game** button.\n",
    "- Unzip the DNA helix molecules.\n",
    "- Drag base pairs into empty slots on the DNA strands until three molecules evade me.\n",
    "- Answer the trivia questions that pop up after losing three lives.\n",
    "- Continue playing to try and reach a new high score!\n",
    "\n",
    "After playing, I now understand how DNA editing works and how scientists manipulate DNA to achieve specific traits in organisms. I have a much clearer understanding of what Illumina does and am excited to learn even more!"
