    "    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mb-2\">Game Structure and Components:</h2>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    The frontend of DNA Dynamite consists of modular JavaScript files located in the <code>assets/js/dynamite</code> folder. These files form the core logic for DNA strand behavior, user interaction, score tracking, and UI state. The game uses canvas rendering to create an interactive gameplay experience with real-time updates.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each component is separated into its own file to maintain clean and organized logic. When the game loads, scripts initialize game elements, draw the DNA strands, detect interactions, and handle user input (via keyboard or other controls).\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    We use a Tailwind CSS template to maintain organized, responsive, and scalable documentation and design structure.\n",

    "    <strong>Files Created In Frontend:</strong>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    - <strong>BaseMoving.js</strong> — Defines the motion and scrolling behavior of DNA strands on the screen.<br>\n",
    "    - <strong>GameController.js</strong> — Manages start, pause, resume, and game speed controls.<br>\n",
    "    - <strong>GameEnv.js</strong> — Sets up the canvas, handles score, lives, and game rendering loop.<br>\n",
    "    - <strong>GameSetup.js</strong> — Initializes the game elements and configuration at page load.<br>\n",
    "    - <strong>GameObject.js</strong> — Defines object traits like collision detection, destruction, and speed.<br>\n",
    "    - <strong>ScoreAPI.js</strong> — Connects to backend API for saving and retrieving high scores.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mb-2\">Main Page Integration:</h2>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    The game is embedded in the main site using <code>index.md</code>. This file links to all the essential scripts and displays the canvas on which the game is played. It is designed to work with static site generators like Jekyll but can also be adapted to plain HTML if needed.\n",

    "    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mb-2\">Styling with Tailwind CSS:</h2>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    Tailwind CSS is used throughout the frontend for layout, color, typography, and responsive design. Styling is applied directly using utility classes in HTML and JavaScript DOM elements.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples of commonly used Tailwind classes:\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    - <code>bg-pink-500</code> — Base pair background color (A–T)<br>\n",
    "    - <code>bg-blue-500</code> — Base pair background color (G–C)<br>\n",
    "    - <code>text-black</code> — Ensures clear readability across elements<br>\n",
    "    - <code>rounded-lg shadow-md p-4</code> — Used on game containers and cards<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mb-2\">Tailwind Template Use:</h2>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    To maintain clean and readable documentation and UI components, we use a prebuilt Tailwind CSS documentation template. This ensures consistency in layout, color scheme, and spacing across different sections of the project.\n",
